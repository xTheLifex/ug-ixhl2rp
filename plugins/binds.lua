This plugin allows you to bind keys to commands forcefully for players.

To bind a key to a command, you can use many different methods. Here are some examples:

Here is an example of binding the F1 key to the command "ix_togglethirdperson" as a function:
```lua
PLUGIN.binds[KEY_F1] = function(ply, bind, pressed)
    RunConsoleCommand("ix_togglethirdperson")
end
```

Or you can bind the F2 key to the command "ix_togglethirdperson" as a string:
```lua
PLUGIN.binds[KEY_F2] = "ix_togglethirdperson"
```

Along with that, you can bind the F3 key to the command "ix_togglethirdperson" and "say Hello, world!" as a table which must take strings:
```lua
PLUGIN.binds[KEY_F3] = {"ix_togglethirdperson", "say Hello, world!"}
```
]]

if ( SERVER ) then
    return
end

PLUGIN.binds = PLUGIN.binds or {}

PLUGIN.binds[KEY_F1] = function(ply, bind, pressed)
    RunConsoleCommand("ix_togglethirdperson")
end

PLUGIN.binds[KEY_F4] = "ix_togglethirdperson"

function PLUGIN:PlayerBindPress(ply, bind, pressed)
    local data = self.binds[bind]
    if ( data ) then
        // comment: the power of yandere dev else if statements
        if ( type(data) == "function" ) then
            return data(ply, bind, pressed)
        elseif ( type(data) == "string" ) then
            RunConsoleCommand(data)
        elseif ( type(data) == "table" ) then
            for k, v in ipairs(data) do
                RunConsoleCommand(v)
            end
        else
            RunConsoleCommand(data)
        end
    end
end
