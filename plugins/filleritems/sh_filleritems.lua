    Life's Filler Items - Item Template
    =====================================

    These are basic, often non-functional items used for roleplay flavor, worldbuilding,
    scene dressing, or lore purposes. They're easy to make and entirely visual/custom.

    After defining your items in a table, pass them to:
        PLUGIN:AddItemTable(items)

    ðŸ§  Notes
    ------------------------
    - This system is meant for simple prop items that don't do anything functional.
    - `models` can be a table for randomization â€” useful for junk, scraps, paper, etc.
    - No use function is defined, but you can extend this system with your own if needed.
    - Good for background clutter, scavenging RP, and environmental storytelling.
