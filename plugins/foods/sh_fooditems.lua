    Life's Food Items - Item Definition
    =====================================

    Use this format to define various types of food-related items.
    Once the items are defined in a table, pass them into:
        PLUGIN:AddFoodItemTable(items)

    Supports:
    - Regular food (with optional trash item)
    - Trash items (junk, not usable)
    - Package items (contain multiple items/tokens when unpacked)

        istrash     = true,                           -- Marks item as trash (non-usable, changes category/desc)
        pack        = {                               -- Marks item as a package and defines its contents

    }

    PLUGIN:AddFoodItemTable(foodItems)

    -------------------------
    üî• Notes
    -------------------------
    - `istrash` disables item functions and marks the item as junk.
    - `pack` turns the item into a package with an "Unpack" option.
    - If both `istrash` and `pack` are false/nil, the item gets a "Consume" function.
    - After consumption, `trash` item is added or spawned if inventory is full.
    - You can add random model selection via `models = {...}`.
