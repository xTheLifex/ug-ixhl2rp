    ðŸ”§ Item Structure

    ["unique_id"] = {
        name        = "Pretty Name",              -- Item display name (default: "Unnamed Health Item")
        desc        = "A short description.",     -- Item description (fallbacks: desc > description > default string)
        model       = "models/...mdl",            -- Model path (default: garbage_bag001a)
        models      = {                           -- OPTIONAL: list of random models
                        "models/foo.mdl",

        skin        = 0,                          -- Model skin (default: 0)
        category    = "Health Items",             -- Category in inventory (default: "Medical Items")

        hp          = 25,                         -- OPTIONAL: Amount to heal (default: 10 if none set and no custom use)
        sound       = "path/to/sound.wav",        -- OPTIONAL: Custom sound on use

        use         = function(item)              -- OPTIONAL: Custom use function. Overrides default heal behavior.
                        local client = item.player
                        client:SetHealth(client:GetMaxHealth())
                    end,

        functions   = {                           -- OPTIONAL: Full custom override of item functions
            ["Use"] = {
                name = "Use",
                tip = "Use this item",
                icon = "icon16/add.png",
                OnRun = function(item)
                    -- Your code here
                end

    ðŸ“¦ Example Usage
    -------------------------

            desc = "Fully restores your health.",
            model = "models/props_lab/box01a.mdl",

                local client = item.player

    ðŸ”¥ Notes
    -------------------------
    - If 'models' is defined (as a table of model strings), a random model will be picked and stored per item instance.
    - If 'use' is defined, it'll override default healing behavior (uses 'hp' value otherwise).
    - If you fully define 'functions', you're on your own â€” don't define 'hp' or 'use' in that case unless you're using them inside.
